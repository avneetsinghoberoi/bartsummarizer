HYPER PARAMETER TUNING OF BART SUMMARIZER

In this project, I focused on optimizing the performance of the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) Transformer model for text summarization tasks through hyperparameter tuning. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model with a standard Transformer-based architecture that is particularly well-suited for text generation tasks such as summarization.This project highlights the critical role of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing the capabilities of state-of-the-art NLP models and contributes to the field by offering a structured approach to optimizing Transformer models for summarization tasks.
